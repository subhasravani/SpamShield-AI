# SpamShield-AI
SpamShield AI is a deep learning-based spam detection model that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify text messages as spam or not spam. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on basic algorithms like Naive Bayes, this project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, making it more powerful at understanding context in text and identifying spam with greater accuracy.

Project Overview
In this project, we:

Preprocessed a dataset of SMS messages by tokenizing and padding text sequences.
Built and trained an LSTM model to classify messages as spam or not spam.
Evaluated the model on a test set to determine its performance.
With SpamShield AI, users can input text messages and get real-time predictions on whether a message is likely to be spam.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpamShieldAI.git
cd SpamShieldAI
Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7 or higher), then install the required libraries.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Use any SMS spam collection dataset in CSV format.
For example, you could use the Kaggle SMS Spam Collection dataset.
Place the dataset file in the project directory and update the code to load it.
Preprocess the data: Tokenize and pad the text sequences based on model requirements:

python
Copy code
python preprocess.py  # or integrate in your main code
Train the model: Run the training script to train the LSTM model:

python
Copy code
python train_model.py
Usage
Once you've trained the model, you can use it to make predictions on new messages.

Input Text Message: Run the script to classify a message:

python
Copy code
python predict.py --text "Your free entry in 2 days to win a prize!"
Model Prediction: The model will output a prediction indicating whether the message is Spam or Not Spam.

Model Performance
Accuracy: 87%
Other Metrics: The model's performance was evaluated with additional metrics:
Precision, Recall, F1-Score
ROC-AUC score
The model was also evaluated using a confusion matrix to identify areas where improvements can be made.
